# Before you start

To implement GreenLeaze you must ask for an API key. You can do this by contacting us here [https://www.greenleaze.com/contact](https://www.greenleaze.com/contact).
You can test the API key by using the following request :

```bash
curl --location 'https://new.api.greenleaze.com/v1' \
--header 'X-API-KEY: ••••••'
```
