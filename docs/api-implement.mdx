# API

The REST API makes it able to retrieve prices rules from GreenLeaze, create an order and then follow the order status.

## How the GreenLeaze Payment Path Integration Works

1. The store retrieves the pricing rules from GreenLeaze.
2. The store displays the pricings to the customer in the way he wants to.
3. The store sends a request containing data in JSON to GreenLeaze to create an order.
4. The store redirects the customer to GreenLeaze to complete the order.
5. GreenLeaze processes the order and sends the customer back to the store.
6. GreenLeaze sends a webhook to the store to notify the new order status.

## API Authentication

All requests to the API must be authenticated with an API key. The API key must be included in the `X-API-KEY` header of the request. This token is unique to your shop **and must be kept secret**.

## Pricing Rules

### Get Pricing Rules

<details>
<summary>
```
GET /v1/price-rules
```
</summary>
```json title="Request response"
[
  //...
  {
    "id": 30,
    "name": "0 2000 1 mois",
    "rule": "(1.2* [[prixHT]] /11.9) + (1.2-[[tva]])*[[prixHT]]/11.9", // [[tva]] represent the taxes of the product - Used to calculate the monthly price
    "depositRule": "(1.2* [[prixHT]] /11.9) + (1.2-[[tva]])*[[prixHT]]/11.9", // [[tva]] represent the taxes of the product - Used for first payment
    "minPrice": "0.00", // This is the price without taxes !
    "maxPrice": "2000.00", // This is the price without taxes !
    "duration": 6 // Can be 1, 6, 12, 18 or 24 months depending on the contract with GreenLeaze
}
//...
]

```
</details>

The request returns all rules concerning your shop. A rule applies to all products whose price is between **minPrice** and **maxPrice** and for the corresponding duration.

From all the rules you are able to let your customer choose his duration and the corresponding price will be calculated according to the rule. If the product is not in the range of any rule, the product is not egilageable for GreenLeaze Renting.

**Please store the rules in user session to avoid multiple requests to the API. It will improve user experience for all customers.**

### Change Pricing Rules

You can not change the pricing rules with the API. If you need to change the pricing rules, please contact us.

          "cartId": "",
          "cartSecureKey": "",
          "email": "",
          "firstName": "",
          "lastName": "",
          "deliveryAddress": {
            "street": "",
            "city": "",
            "country": "",
            "postCode": "",
            "phone": "",
            "firstName": "",
            "lastName": "",
          },
          "invoiceAddress": {
            "street": "",
            "city": "",
            "country": "",
            "postCode": "",
            "phone": "",
            "firstName": "",
            "lastName": "",

          "greenleazeSubscriptionId": "",

          "monthlyRentalPayment": 1,
          "deliveryMode": {
            "name": "",
