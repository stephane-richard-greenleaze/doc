# Webhooks

## Basic informations

You may use webhooks to listen for events from Greenleaze and implement your own logic.

GreenLeaze has 3 types of webhooks:

- Transaction specific webhooks;

They are defined in the payload when creating a transaction and are signed with the api key used to create the transaction.
If you use the GreenLeaze module for Prestashop or Shopify, the module will automatically configure theses webhooks for each transaction, for API integration you need to indicate the webhook url in the payload.

- Event webhooks;

They are configured in the GreenLeaze dashboard, you may have multiple webhooks for the same event.
You may choose if they trigger for all orders, only for orders created by the dashboard or only for orders created by the API. It enables you to create different logics for each type of orders.

- Configuration webhooks.

They are used to retrieve specific elements from your CMS, like products or discount-codes. Their goal is to avoid data dupication and permit the user to use GreenLeaze with existing data of your shop.

They are defined in the payload when creating a transaction and are signed with the secret key used to create the transaction.

Theses are the only webhooks that are listening for a response which must be formatted in a specific way.

## Payloads details

# Specific configuration

By default all webhooks are sending the customer data on every fields. But you may want to retrieve Greenleaze informations as billing informations to simplify your process.
You may do this by checking "Use Greenleaze informations" in the webhook configuration page on the dashboard.
If checked, the webhooks "Order confirmed" and "Success" will be sent with Greenleaze data as email and invoice address. Non-reply email "orders-noreply@greenleaze.com" will be used as email. This email must not be used for sending your invoices as it won't be read by Greenleaze.
