# Before you start

To implement GreenLeaze you must ask for an API key. You can do this by contacting us here [https://www.greenleaze.com/contact](https://www.greenleaze.com/contact).
You can test the API key by using the following request :

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.greenleaze.com/" -H "accept: application/json \
--header 'X-API-KEY: ••••••'
```
