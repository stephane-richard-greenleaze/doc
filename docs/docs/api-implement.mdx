# API

The REST API makes it able to retrieve prices rules from GreenLeaze, create an order and then follow the order status.

## How the GreenLeaze Payment Path Integration Works

1. The store retrieves the pricing rules from GreenLeaze.
2. The store displays the pricings to the custome in the way he wants to.
3. The store sends a request containing data in JSON to GreenLeaze to create an order.
4. The store redirects the customer to GreenLeaze to complete the order.
5. GreenLeaze processes the order and sends the customer back to the store.
6. The store sends a request to GreenLeaze to give the unique order id (id_commande) to finalize the order.

## API Authentication

All requests to the API must be authenticated with an API key. The API key must be included in the `X-API-KEY` header of the request. This token is unique to your shop and must be kept secret.

## Pricing Rules

### Get Pricing Rules

<details>
<summary>
```
GET https://api.greenleaze.com/api/v1/pricing-rules
```
</summary>
```json title="Request response"
[
  //...
  {
    "id": 30,
    "name": "0 2000 1 mois",
    "rule": "(1.2* [[prixHT]] /11.9) + (1.2-[[rate]])*[[prixHT]]/11.9", // [[rate]] represent the taxes of the product (tva)
    "minPrice": "0.00",
    "maxPrice": "2000.00",
    "duration": 6 // Can be 6, 12, 18 or 24 months
  }
  //...
]
```
</details>

The request returns all rules concerning your shop. A rule applies to all products whose price is between **minPrice** and **maxPrice** and for the corresponding duration.

From all the rules you are able to let your customer to choose his duration and the price will be calculated according to the rule. If the product is not in the range of any rule, the product is not egilageable for GreenLeaze Renting.

**Please store the rules in user session to avoid multiple requests to the API. It will improve user experience for all customers.**

### Change Pricing Rules

You can not change the pricing rules with the API. If you need to change the pricing rules, please contact us.

## Send data to GreenLeaze

### Step 1 : Send the order to pay.greenleaze.com

Once your customer has made his order on your website, you must send the order to GreenLeaze to create the order.

```
</summary>
```json title="Request body"

}
```

</details>

### Step 2 : Redirect the customer to pay.greenleaze.com

Once the order has been sent to GreenLeaze, you must redirect the customer to the GreenLeaze payment page, the previous request will return the URL to redirect the customer.
You must redirect the customer to the URL returned by the previous request.

`POST https://pay.greenleaze.com/order/step-1?transaction_id={transactionId}`
Be sure to replace `{transactionId}` by the transactionId you have sent in the previous request.

### Step 3 : Send back the order id to GreenLeaze

Once the customer has completed the payment, he will be redirected to the (success) URL you have provided in the request to create the order.
Four parameters will be added to the (success) URL :

- `number-of-months` : Indicates the duration of the rental in months. This information allows you to define the appropriate status for the order on your shop, such as "GreenLeaze Rent 24 months".
- `cart-secure-key` : Unique identifier of the cart or order, which you will have included in the JSON data sent. This identifier, which is unknown to the customer, must match exactly the one recorded on your shop to avoid fraudulent validation of the order. In case of divergence between the cart-secure-key sent and the one received, the order should not be validated.
- `cart-id` : Used to validate the order with reference to the cart ID.
- `greenleaze-subscription-id` : This identifier will be necessary to communicate to the API the order number generated on your shop. **Use the endpoint `/api/subscriptions/{id}` with the PATCH method to update the order `shopOrderId`.**
