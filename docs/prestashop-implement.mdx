- Listen for order creations to handle your own logic.

## Install the module GreenLeaze on your PrestaShop store

This step is done by GreenLeaze. Please contact us to get the module. Each module is linked to a specific configuration.

## Configure the module with your GreenLeaze account credentials

Configure the module with your GreenLeaze account API key and the URL of the api depending on your needs :

- Development : https://staging.api.greenleaze.com
- Production : https://new.api.greenleaze.com

## Unhook the buttons you do not want to use

You can unhook the buttons you do not want to use by unchecking the corresponding option in the module configuration (or in appearance > positions).
The default buttons are :

- On the product page ;
- On the cart page ;
- On the add to cart page ;
- On the checkout page ;
- On the product listing pages.

## Customizing your store theme

You can customize the styling of the GreenLeaze widget by editing the css file of your theme and using the appropriate selectors you can find by right clicking on the widget and selecting "Inspect" in your browser.

## Disable the module for specific products if needed

At installation Greenleaze Subscriptions is enabled for all products. You can disable it for specific products by checking the "Disable GreenLeaze for this product" option in the product admin page options tab.

## Listen for order creations to handle your own logic

Depending on your Prestashop integration you may want to implement a custom logic when an order is created. By default All orders are created on your shop with a status 'Greenleaze'. You can look for orders with this status and implement your own logic.
If you prefer implementing your own system you can implement Greenleaze by API or modify the module webhooks endpoint.
