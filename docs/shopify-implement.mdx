Greenleaze provides a custom shopify app so you can easily integrate GreenLeaze into your shopify store.
The integration is done in 3 steps :

- Install the custom app GreenLeaze on your shopify store ;
- Customize your store theme to display the greenleaze widget the way you want.

## Install the custom app GreenLeaze on your shopify store

This step is done by GreenLeaze. Please contact us to install the custom app on your shopify store.

## Add Greenleaze assets files

On your Shopify store, you need to add the following svg files (content > files):

- [logo-greenleaze-fond-blanc](../static/img/logo-greenleaze-fond-blanc.svg) ;
- [logo-greenleaze-fond-vert](../static/img/logo-greenleaze-fond-vert.svg) ;
- [logo-greenleaze-slider](../static/img/logo-greenleaze-slider.svg) ;
- [progress-bar-greenleaze](../static/img/progress-bar-greenleaze.svg) ;
- [greenleaze-illustration-bike](../static/img/greenleaze-illustration-bike.svg) ;
- [greenleaze-illustration-casse-vol](../static/img/greenleaze-illustration-casse-vol.svg) ;
- [greenleaze-illustration-franchise](../static/img/greenleaze-illustration-franchise.svg) ;
- [greenleaze-illustration-replacement](../static/img/greenleaze-illustration-replacement.svg) ;

Respect the name of the files or you will have to edit the code to match the new names.

## Add Product Metafields

You need to add the following custom metafields to your store :

- Go to your Shopify admin, click on Content then on MetaObjects ;
- Click on "Add a definition" then "Personalized data" and "products" then "Add a definition" ;
- Fill the form with the following values :
  - "Disable GreenLeaze for this product" ;
  - greenleaze.disabled ;
  - "Disable GreenLeaze for this product" ;
  - Type : True or False.

## Customizing your store theme

We recommand displaying the GreenLeaze widget on the product page and the cart page, the widget will allow your customers to choose the duration of the rental and see the monthly price.

In all cases you need to add the greenleaze-script.js file to your store in assets/greenleaze-script.js and the modal template in snippets/greenleaze-abonnement-modal.liquid.

[Download greenleaze-script.js](./file/greenleaze-script.js)
[Download greenleaze-abonnement-modal.liquid](./file/greenleaze-abonnement-modal.liquid)

You can edit the durations and the default duration in the greenleaze-script.js file and in the greenleaze-abonnement-modal.liquid file.

In the script file you can edit `var monthValues = [1, 12, 24, 36];` to set all the durations compatible with your store.
You may also need to edit the durations for the modal, the following code is an example for 1, 12, 18 and 24 and 36 months. You have to adapt the following lines to edit them :
Don't forget the "max" value of the input range must be the length of the monthValues array minus one.

```html
<input
  type="range"
  id="monthSlider-greenleaze"
  min="0"
  max="3"
  step="any"
  value="0"
/>
<div class="slider-labels-greenleaze">
  <span>1 mois</span>
  <span>12 mois</span>
  <span>24 mois</span>
  <span>36 mois</span>
</div>
```

### Display the GreenLeaze widget on the product page

1. Create a new snippet `greenleaze-abonnement-product.liquid`, it will hold a button GreenLeaze.
   The following code must be customized to fit your store design.

[Download greenleaze-abonnement-product.liquid ](./file/greenleaze-abonnement-product.liquid)

You may need to edit the data-price attribute to correctly get the price of the product for your store.

You must also edit the data-duration attribute to match the default duration you want to display when the modal is opened.

```javascript
 data-price="{{product.price}}"
 data-duration="36"
```

Finally, you must edit the following line to match the lenght of the monthValues array minus one (here 3 because we have 4 durations) :

```javascript
data-value="3"
```

2.  Import the snippet in your product template `product.liquid` or file where you want to display the widget

```liquid
{% render 'greenleaze-abonnement-product' %}
```

### Display the GreenLeaze widget on the cart page

1. Create a new snippet `greenleaze-abonnement-cart.liquid`, it will hold a GreenLeaze button to display the prices of each product in the cart. The following code must be customized to fit your store design.

[Download greenleaze-abonnement-product.liquid ](./file/greenleaze-abonnement-cart.liquid)

You may need to edit the same values as for the product widget.

2. Import the snippet in your cart template `main-cart.liquid` or file where you want to display the widget

```liquid
{% render 'greenleaze-abonnement-cart' %}
```

3. Call rerender when the cart is updated

You can call the event `greenleazePriceActualize` on window when the cart is updated so the price is correctly displayed.

```javascript
window.dispatchEvent(greenleazePriceActualize);
```

You can also add a listener to one of your them event in greenleaze-abonnement-modal of greenleaze-script to refresh the data when you want.

### Display the GreenLeaze price on the collection page

1. Create a new snippet `greenleaze-abonnement-product-preview.liquid`, it will hold the price of the product on the collection card.

[Download greenleaze-abonnement-product-preview.liquid](./file/greenleaze-abonnement-product-preview.liquid)

2. Import the snippet in your theme product-card.liquid file or other template where you want to display the price, just before the product price.

```liquid
{% render 'greenleaze-abonnement-product-preview' %}
```
